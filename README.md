# Training - Operating the Foundry training

Training materials for **Operating a Platform: BOSH and Everything Else**

## Summary

Have you ever wondered how to deploy and operate a platform that's designed to deploy and operate applications? Join us and find out how with a hands-on training workshop. We'll teach you how to deploy and manage the Cloud Foundry platform as well as the stateful data services that power cloud-native applications. We'll provide an operational overview of Cloud Foundry and data services, and how these can be deployed with the cluster orchestration tool, "BOSH".  

This training is targeted at people with little to no Cloud Foundry BOSH experience but who have some experience managing Linux-based systems. If you're curious to learn how BOSH can help you deploy and manage Cloud Foundry and other complex systems, this is the course for you.
